# Ocean Tide Simulator
---
## How to Run?
### Requirements
- Java 17+
- JavaFX
### Running the Project
1. Clone the git repository in the IDE of your choice (preferably Netbeans).
2. Add JavaFX libraries to your module path.
3. Run OceanTideSimulator.java to start the simulation.

## What is the Project?
- Simulates and visualizes an ocean tide based on real-world physics.
- Animates the rotations of the Sun, Earth, and Moon to reflect changes.
- Calculates the tide height over a simulated time scale (Default: 1 second = 1 simulated day).
- Allows the user to change the following values to be reflected by the simulation:
  - Moon distance
  - Gravitational acceleration
  - The Sun's gravitational effect
  - Speed of the simulation
